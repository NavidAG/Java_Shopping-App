# ShoppingApp
This is a University project resembling a Shopping app and shopping management

This is a shopping app which my teammate and I made (A university project, actually). This is very immature due to our *naive* understanding of what a object-oriented language is. As you can see in the directories, this projects lacks fundamental principles of a project. Considering all of this, this is a suitable example for staters.

Developed using Java and JavaFX, with somehow beautiful UI. I decided to put this in GitHub so it might be helpful to some developers. 
## My intention is to contribute to open-source community.
